I building a system that allows us to do some things:

1]Add new users: This means we can create accounts.
2]Update client users: We can make changes to the information of existing users who are associated with our clients.
3]Retrieve all users: We can see a list of all the users in our system.

  Using Spring for the backend, which helps us manage the logic of our system, 
  and we're testing our system's functionality using an API testing tool.

 And using MySQL retrive data(client, companyn ClientUser) using custome quary
